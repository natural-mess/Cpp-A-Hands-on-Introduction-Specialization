# Lab Challenge
## Problem
Create a `BankAccount` struct in the IDE to the left which has two double attributes checking and savings. Create a function called `ToString` within the struct that prints a representation of a `BankAccount` struct which includes these attributes.

You can use the code `cout << setprecision(2) << fixed` followed by a specified value to set that value to two decimal places.
