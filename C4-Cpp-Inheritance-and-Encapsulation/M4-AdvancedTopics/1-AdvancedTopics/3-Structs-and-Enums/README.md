# Structs & Enums
## What are Structs?
Structs are like classes, except everything inside a struct is **public**. Therefore, anything external to the struct can alter its members. For example:

```cpp
//add class definitions below this line

struct Person {
    string name;
    int age;
    double salary;
};

//add class definitions above this line

int main() {
  
  //add code below this line

  Person p;
  p.age = 50;
  cout << p.age << endl;

  //add code above this line
  
  return 0;
  
}
```

In the example above, after creating the `struct` called `Person`, we are able to access the `age` attribute by simply using dot notation and specifying the attribute. If security is not an issue, structs are useful at putting together a collection of attributes that are highly modifiable and accessible.

## Setting Values with Enums
Enums are similar to **switch-case** statements where particular values are assigned to particular cases. See example below:

```cpp
//add class definitions below this line

enum grades {A = 90, B = 80, C = 70, D = 60};

//add class definitions above this line

int main() {
  
  //add code below this line

  grades grade;

  grade = A;
  cout << "Grade = " << grade << endl;

  //add code above this line
  
  return 0;
  
}
```

Cases (variables) of the alphabet from A through D have been assigned to variable integers from 90 backwards to 60 in increments of 10. When you create a `grades` enum, you can assign it to any of the cases specified in the enum definition. This will signal to the system to assign the `grades` enum to appropriate integer equivalent.

Enum values must be integers. For example, you canâ€™t create an enum with string values.

If the enum variables are not assigned values, the first variable will be 0 by default. The second variable will be 1 and so on. Additionally, the incrementation of 1 happens following the first value of the initialized enum variable. For example, `enum fruit {apple = 5, banana, orange};` causes apple to have a value of 5 and each variable after will have a value incremented by 1. This means `banana` will have a value of 6 and `orange` will have a value of 7. On the other hand, `enum fruit {apple, banana = 5, orange};` causes `apple` to be 0, `banana` to be 5, and `orange` to be 6.
