# Lab Challenge
## Problem
In the IDE to the left, the class `Chef` is already defined, as is the `Display` function. However, it does not have a constructor. Create three constructors that take one, two, and three parameters respectively. Note that the attributes `name` and `cuisine` are set to `"null"` while `michelinStars` is set to `0` by default.

## Expected Output
Three `Chef` objects are instantiated, each one using a different constructor. Calling the `Display` function for each object should return the following text:

|Function Call|	Return Value|
|-|-|
|c1.Display()|	Marco Pierre White is known for null cuisine and has 0 Michelin stars.|
|c2.Display()|	Rene Redzepi is known for Nordic cuisine and has 0 Michelin stars.|
|c3.Display()|	Thomas Keller is known for French cuisine and has 3 Michelin stars.|
