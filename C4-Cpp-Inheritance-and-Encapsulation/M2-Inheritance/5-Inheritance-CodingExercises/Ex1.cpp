// Use the CelestialBody class to the left as the base class. 
// Create the Satellite and Planet classes, both of which are derived classes of CelestialBody. 
// The Satellite class has the attribute string host_planet while the Planet class has the attribute string host_star.
// Expected Output
// Satellite name = Moon, size = 2651, mass = 3716, atmospheric composition = helium, host planet = Earth
// Planet name = Earth, size = 5349, mass = 8910, atmospheric composition = nitrogen, host star = Sun
// Satellite name = Titan, size = 3199, mass = 13452, atmospheric composition = nitrogen, host planet = Saturn
// Planet name = Saturn, size = 82713, mass = 56834, atmospheric composition = hydrogen, host star = Sun
