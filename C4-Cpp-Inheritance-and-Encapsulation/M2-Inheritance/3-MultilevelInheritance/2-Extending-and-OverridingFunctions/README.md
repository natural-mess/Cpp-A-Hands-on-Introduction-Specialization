# Extending & Overriding Functions
## Extending a Class within Multilevel Inheritance
Multilevel inheritance works just like single inheritance except there are more than one derived class. Add the following code as class definitions in the text editor.

```cpp
//add class definitions below this line

class ClassC : public ClassB {
  public:
    void Bonjour() {
      cout << "Bonjour" << endl;
    }
};

//add class definitions above this line
```

Instantiate a `ClassC` object to call the `Bonjour` function. Then use the scope resolution operator `:` to invoke the `Hello` function from both `ClassB` and `ClassA`.

```cpp
  //add code below this line

  ClassC c;
  c.Bonjour();
  c.ClassB::Hello();
  c.ClassA::Hello();

  //add code above this line
```

## Overriding a Function within Multilevel Inheritance
Like extending a class, overriding a function works the same in multilevel inheritance as it does in single inheritance. Change `ClassC` so that it overrides the `Hello` function.

```cpp
//add class definitions below this line

class ClassC : public ClassB {
  public:
    void Hello() {
      cout << "Hello from Class C" << endl;
    }
};

//add class definitions above this line
```

Now replace the call to `Bonjour` with a call to `Hello`.

```cpp
  //add code below this line

  ClassC c;
  c.Hello();
  c.ClassB::Hello();
  c.ClassA::Hello();

  //add code above this line
```

Notice how calling the `Hello` function automatically defaults to the function within the objectâ€™s specified class. If you want to call the same function as specified from within another base class, simply use the scope resolution operator `:` as shown above.
