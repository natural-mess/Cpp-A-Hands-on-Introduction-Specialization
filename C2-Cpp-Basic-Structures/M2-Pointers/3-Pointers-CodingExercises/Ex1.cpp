// Complete the program so that the pointer thatâ€™s associated with the larger value is printed. 
// For example, if a is larger than b, then the system will print *p1. 
// Else if b is larger than a, then the system will print *p2. 
// If neither is larger, then the system will print Neither number is larger. 
// Your output should look like this:
// The larger number is <?>
// Where <?> represents the larger valued pointer. Or if neither is larger, then the output will be:
// Neither number is larger
