// Write a program that divides 7 by 2 and prints out the result (3.5) without using the printf() command. 
// Your program must do the following things:
// Declare two variables and assign them to the appropriate values, and use them to calculate your quotient of 3.5.
// Include just one division (/) operator in your code.
// Use just one cout << statement.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  
  //add code below this line

  double num1 = 7.0;
  double num2 = 2.0;
  cout << num1 / num2 << endl;

  //add code above this line
  
  return 0;
