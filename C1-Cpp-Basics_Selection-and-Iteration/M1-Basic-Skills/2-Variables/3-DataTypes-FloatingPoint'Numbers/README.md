# Data Types: Floating Point Numbers
## Floating Point Numbers
Floating point numbers (often called floats) are numbers with a decimal. They can be positive or negative. 

## Why Use Double Instead of Float?
In C++, there is a data type called float, but as it only uses 4 bytes, it is insufficient for most math. Instead, we use double which uses 8 bytes or double the space of a float.

## Exercise

A `double` is a floating point number or a rational number meaning it has a decimal or represents a fraction, where an `int` (short for integer) is a whole number meaning it does not have a decimal.

Both can be positive or negative!
